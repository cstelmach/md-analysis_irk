## Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Insulin Receptor Kinase (IRK)

**Overview**  
This repository hosts the energy-minimized protein structures derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations exploring the feasibility of cis-autophosphorylation in IRK.

**Content**  
- Post-energy minimization protein structures from MD simulations.

**Objective**  
These structures support our investigation into the structural feasibility of IRK's cis-autophosphorylation, challenging established perspectives on its steric possibilities.
